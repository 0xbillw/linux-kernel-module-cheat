Run one command, get a QEMU or gem5 Buildroot BusyBox virtual machine built from source with several minimal Linux kernel 4.15 module development example tutorials with GDB and KGDB step debugging and minimal educational hardware models. "Tested" in x86, ARM and MIPS guests, Ubuntu 17.10 host.

toc::[]

== Getting started

Reserve 12Gb of disk and run:

....
git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat
cd linux-kernel-module-cheat
./configure && ./build && ./run
....

The first configure will take a while (30 minutes to 2 hours) to clone and build, see <<benchmarking-this-repo>> for more details.

If you don't want to wait, you could also try to compile the examples and run them on your host computer as explained on at <<run-on-host>>, but as explained on that section, that is dangerous, limited, and will likely not work.

After QEMU opens up, you can start playing with the kernel modules:

....
root
insmod /hello.ko
insmod /hello2.ko
rmmod hello
rmmod hello2
....

This should print to the screen:

....
hello init
hello2 init
hello cleanup
hello2 cleanup
....

which are `printk` messages from `init` and `cleanup` methods of those modules.

image:screenshot.png[image]

All available modules can be found in the link:kernel_module/[`kernel_module` directory].

=== Module documentation

....
head kernel_module/modulename.c
....

Many of the modules have userland test scripts / executables with the same name as the module, e.g. form inside the guest:

....
/modulename.sh
/modulename.out
....

The sources of those tests will further clarify what the corresponding kernel modules does. To find them on the host, do a quick:

....
git ls-files | grep modulename
....

=== Rebuild

After making changes to a package, you must explicitly tell it to be rebuilt.

For example, you you modify the kernel modules, you must rebuild with:

....
./build -k
....

which is just an alias for:

....
./build -- kernel_module-reconfigure
....

where `kernel_module` is the name of out Buildroot package that contains the kernel modules.

Other important targets are:

....
./build -- linux-reconfigure host-qemu-reconfigure
....

which are aliased respectively to:

....
./build -l -q
....

We don't rebuild by default because, even with `make` incremental rebuilds, the timestamp check takes a few annoying seconds.

=== Clean the build

You did something crazy, and nothing seems to work anymore?

All builds are stored under `buildroot/`,

The most coarse thing you can do is:

....
cd buildroot
git checkout -- .
git clean -xdf .
....

To only nuke one architecture, do:

....
rm -rf buildroot/output.x86_64~
....

Only nuke one one package:

....
rm -rf buildroot/output.x86_64~/build/host-qemu-custom
./build -q
....

This is sometimes necessary when changing the version of the submodules, and then builds fail. We should try to understand why and report bugs.

=== Filesystem persistency

The root filesystem is persistent across:

....
./run
date >f
# poweroff syncs by default without -n.
poweroff
....

then:

....
./run
cat f
....

The command:

....
sync
....

also saves the disk.

This is particularly useful to re-run shell commands from the history of a previous session with `Ctrl + R`.

However, when you do:

....
./build
....

the disk image gets overwritten by a fresh filesystem and you lose all changes.

Remember that if you forcibly turn QEMU off without `sync` or `poweroff` from inside the VM, e.g. by closing the QEMU window, disk changes may not be saved.

When booting from <<initrd>> however without a disk, persistency is lost.

=== Message control

We use `printk` a lot, and it shows on the QEMU terminal by default. If that annoys you (e.g. you want to see stdout separately), do:

....
dmesg -n 1
....

See also: https://superuser.com/questions/351387/how-to-stop-kernel-messages-from-flooding-my-console

You can scroll up a bit on the default TTY with:

....
Shift + PgUp
....

but I never managed to increase that buffer:

* https://askubuntu.com/questions/709697/how-to-increase-scrollback-lines-in-ubuntu14-04-2-server-edition
* https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/346018/how-to-increase-the-scrollback-buffer-size-for-tty

The superior alternative is to use text mode or a telnet connection.

=== Text mode

Show serial console directly on the current terminal, without opening a QEMU window:

....
./run -n
....

To quit QEMU forcefully, just use Ctrl + C as usual.

This mode is very useful to:

* get full panic traces when you start making the kernel crash :-) See also: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/208260/how-to-scroll-up-after-a-kernel-panic
* copy and paste commands and stdout output to / from host
* have a large scroll buffer, and be able to search it, e.g. by using GNU `screen` on host

Limitations:

* TODO: Ctrl + C kills the emulator, and not sent to guest processes. See:
+

** https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/167165/how-to-pass-ctrl-c-in-qemu
** https://github.com/cloudius-systems/osv/issues/49

+
It is also hard to enter the monitor for the same reason:
--
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14165158/how-to-switch-to-qemu-monitor-console-when-running-with-curses
* https://superuser.com/questions/488263/how-to-switch-to-the-qemu-control-panel-with-nographics
--
+
Our workaround is:
+
....
./qemumonitor
....
+
I think the problem was reversed in older QEMU versions: https://superuser.com/questions/1087859/how-to-quit-the-qemu-monitor-when-not-using-a-gui/1211516#1211516
+
This is however fortunate when running QEMU with GDB, as the Ctrl + C reaches GDB and breaks.
* Very early kernel messages such as `early console in extract_kernel` only show on the GUI, since at such early stages, not even the serial has been setup.

=== Automatic startup commands

When debugging a module, it becomes tedious to wait for build and re-type:

....
root
/modulename.sh
....

every time.

Here are some methods to automate that.

==== Replace init

This method replaces init and evals a command from the <<kernel-command-line-parameters>>:

....
./run -E 'echo "asdf qwer";insmod /hello.ko;/poweroff.out' -n
....

It is basically a shortcut for:

....
./run -e 'init=/eval.sh - lkmc_eval="insmod /hello.ko;/poweroff.out"' -n
....

although `-E` allows for quoting and newlines by using base64 encoding, so you should almost always use it, unless you are really counting each cycle ;-)

If the script is large, you can add it to a gitignored file and pass that to `-E` as in:

....
echo '
insmod /hello.ko
/poweroff.out
' > ignore.sh
./run -E "$(cat ignore.sh)" -n
....

or add it to a file to the root filesystem guest and rebuild:

....
echo '#!/bin/sh
insmod /hello.ko
/poweroff.out
' > rootfs_overlay/ignore.sh
chmod +x rootfs_overlay/ignore.sh
./build
./run -e 'init=/ignore.sh' -n
....

==== Run command at the end of BusyBox init

If you rely on something that BusyBox' init set up for you like networking, this is the way to go:

....
./run -e '- lkmc_eval="insmod /hello.ko;wget -S google.com;poweroff.out;"'
....

or add them to a new `init.d` entry to run at the end o the BusyBox init:

....
cp rootfs_overlay/etc/init.d/S98 rootfs_overlay/etc/init.d/S99
vim S99
./build
./run
....

and they will be run automatically before the login prompt.

`S99` is a git tracked convenience symlink to the gitignored `rootfs_overlay/etc/init.d/S99`

Scripts under `/etc/init.d` are run by `/etc/init.d/rcS`, which gets called by the line `::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS` in `/etc/inittab`.

==== The kernel panics despite poweroff

Just using Busybox' `poweroff` at the end of the `init` does not work and the kernel panics:

....
./run -E poweroff
....

because BusyBox' `poweroff` tries to do some fancy stuff like killing init, likely to allow userland to shutdown nicely.

But this fails when we are `init` itself!

`poweroff` works more brutally and effectively if you add `-f`:

....
./run -E 'poweroff -f'
....

but why not just use your super simple and effective `/poweroff.out` and be done with it?

=== Kernel command line parameters

Bootloaders can pass a string as input to the Linux kernel when it is booting to control its behaviour, much like the `execve` system call does to userland processes.

This allows us to control the behaviour of the kernel without rebuilding anything.

With QEMU, QEMU itself acts as the bootloader, and provides the `-append` option and we expose it through `./run -e`, e.g.:

....
./run -e 'foo bar'
....

Then inside the host, you can check which options were given with:

....
cat /proc/cmdline
....

They are also printed at the beginning of the boot message:

....
dmesg | grep "Command line"
....

See also:

* https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/48601/how-to-display-the-linux-kernel-command-line-parameters-given-for-the-current-bo
* https://askubuntu.com/questions/32654/how-do-i-find-the-boot-parameters-used-by-the-running-kernel

The arguments are documented in the kernel documentation: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html

When dealing with real boards, extra command line options are provided on some magic bootloader configuration file, e.g.:

* GRUB configuration files: https://askubuntu.com/questions/19486/how-do-i-add-a-kernel-boot-parameter
* Raspberry pi `/boot/cmdline.txt` on a magic partition: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/14839/how-to-change-the-kernel-commandline-for-archlinuxarm-on-raspberry-pi-effectly

=== What command was actually run?

When asking for help on upstream repositories outside of this repository, you will need to provide the commands that you are running in detail without referencing our scripts.

For example, QEMU developers will only want to see the final QEMU command that you are running.

We make that easy by building commands as strings, and then echoing them before evaling.

So for example when you run:

....
./run -a arm
....

Stdout shows a line with the full command of type:

....
./buildroot/output.arm~/host/usr/bin/qemu-system-arm -m 128M -monitor telnet::45454,server,nowait -netdev user,hostfwd=tcp::45455-:45455,id=net0 -smp 1  -M versatilepb -append 'root=/dev/sda nokaslr norandmaps printk.devkmsg=on printk.time=y' -device rtl8139,netdev=net0 -dtb ./buildroot/output.arm~/images/versatile-pb.dtb -kernel ./buildroot/output.arm~/images/zImage -serial stdio    -drive file='./buildroot/output.arm~/images/rootfs.ext2.qcow2,if=scsi,format=qcow2'
....

This line is also saved to a file for convenience:

....
cat ./run.log
....

[[gdb]]
== GDB step debugging

To GDB step debug the Linux kernel, first run:

....
./run -d
....

If you want to break immediately at a symbol, e.g. `start_kernel` of the boot sequence, run on another shell:

....
./rungdb start_kernel
....

Now QEMU will stop there, and you can use the normal GDB commands:

....
l
n
c
....

To skip the boot, run just:

....
./rungdb
....

and when you want to break, do `Ctrl + C` from GDB.

To have some fun, you can first run inside QEMU:

....
/count.sh
....

which counts to infinity to stdout, and then in GDB:

....
Ctrl + C
break sys_write
continue
continue
continue
....

And you now control the counting from GDB.

`O=0` is an impossible dream, `O=2` being the default: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29151235/how-to-de-optimize-the-linux-kernel-to-and-compile-it-with-o0 So get ready for some weird jumps, and `<value optimized out>` fun. Why, Linux, why.

=== Kernel module debugging

Loadable kernel modules are a bit trickier since the kernel can place them at different memory locations depending on load order.

So we cannot set the breakpoints before `insmod`.

However, the Linux kernel GDB scripts offer the `lx-symbols` command, which takes care of that beautifully for us:

....
./run -d
./rungdb
....

In QEMU:

....
insmod /timer.ko
....

In GDB, hit `Ctrl + C`, and note how it says:

....
scanning for modules in /home/ciro/bak/git/linux-kernel-module-cheat/buildroot/output.x86_64~/build/linux-custom
loading @0xffffffffc0000000: ../kernel_module-1.0//timer.ko
....

That's `lx-symbols` working! Now simply:

....
b lkmc_timer_callback
c
c
c
....

and we now control the callback from GDB!

Just don't forget to remove your breakpoints after `rmmod`, or they will point to stale memory locations.

TODO: why does `break work_func` for `insmod kthread.ko` not break the first time I `insmod`, but breaks the second time?

See also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28607538/how-to-debug-linux-kernel-modules-with-qemu/44095831#44095831

==== Bypass lx-symbols

Useless, but a good way to show how hardcore you are. From inside QEMU:

....
insmod /fops.ko
cat /proc/modules
....

This will give a line of form:

....
fops 2327 0 - Live 0xfffffffa00000000
....

And then tell GDB where the module was loaded with:

....
Ctrl + C
add-symbol-file ../kernel_module-1.0/fops.ko 0xfffffffa00000000
....

=== Debug kernel early boot

TODO: why can't we break at early startup stuff such as:

....
./rungdb extract_kernel
./rungdb main
....

See also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2589845/what-are-the-first-operations-that-the-linux-kernel-executes-on-boot

=== GDB call

GDB can call functions as explained at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1354731/how-to-evaluate-functions-in-gdb

However this is failing for us:

* some symbols are not visible to `call` even though `b` sees them
* for those that are, `call` fails with an E14 error

E.g.: if we break on `sys_write` on `/count.sh`:

....
>>> call printk(0, "asdf")
Could not fetch register "orig_rax"; remote failure reply 'E14'
>>> b printk
Breakpoint 2 at 0xffffffff81091bca: file kernel/printk/printk.c, line 1824.
>>> call fdget_pos(fd)
No symbol "fdget_pos" in current context.
>>> b fdget_pos
Breakpoint 3 at 0xffffffff811615e3: fdget_pos. (9 locations)
>>>
....

even though `fdget_pos` is the first thing `sys_write` does:

....
581 SYSCALL_DEFINE3(write, unsigned int, fd, const char __user *, buf,
582         size_t, count)
583 {
584     struct fd f = fdget_pos(fd);
....

See also: https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/issues/19

== KGDB

KGDB is kernel dark magic that allows you to GDB the kernel on real hardware without any extra hardware support.

It is useless with QEMU since we already have full system visibility with `-gdb`, but this is a good way to learn it.

Cheaper than JTAG (free) and easier to setup (all you need is serial), but with less visibility as it depends on the kernel working, so e.g.: dies on panic, does not see boot sequence.

Usage:

....
./run -k
./rungdb -k
....

In GDB:

....
c
....

In QEMU:

....
/count.sh &
/kgdb.sh
....

In GDB:

....
b sys_write
c
c
c
c
....

And now you can count from GDB!

If you do: `b sys_write` immediately after `./rungdb -k`, it fails with `KGDB: BP remove failed: <address>`. I think this is because it would break too early on the boot sequence, and KGDB is not yet ready.

See also:

* https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.9/Documentation/DocBook/kgdb.tmpl
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22004616/qemu-kernel-debugging-with-kgdb/44197715#44197715

=== KGDB kernel modules

In QEMU:

....
/kgdb-mod.sh
....

In GDB:

....
lx-symbols ../kernel_module-1.0/
b fop_write
c
c
c
....

and you now control the count.

TODO: if I `-ex lx-symbols` to the `gdb` command, just like done for QEMU `-gdb`, the kernel oops. How to automate this step?

=== KDB

If you modify `runqemu` to use:

....
-append kgdboc=kbd
....

instead of `kgdboc=ttyS0,115200`, you enter a different debugging mode called KDB.

Usage: in QEMU:

....
[0]kdb> go
....

Boot finishes, then:

....
/kgdb.sh
....

And you are back in KDB. Now you can:

....
[0]kdb> help
[0]kdb> bp sys_write
[0]kdb> go
....

And you will break whenever `sys_write` is hit.

The other KDB commands allow you to instruction steps, view memory, registers and some higher level kernel runtime data.

But TODO I don't think you can see where you are in the kernel source code and line step as from GDB, since the kernel source is not available on guest (ah, if only debugging information supported full source).

== gdbserver

Step debug userland processes to understand how they are talking to the kernel.

In guest:

....
/gdbserver.sh /myinsmod.out /hello.ko
....

In host:

....
./rungdbserver kernel_module-1.0/user/myinsmod.out
....

You can find the executable with:

....
find buildroot/output.x86_64~/build -name myinsmod.out
....

TODO: automate the path finding:

* using the executable from under `buildroot/output.x86_64~/target` would be easier as the path is the same as in guest, but unfortunately those executables are stripped to make the guest smaller. `BR2_STRIP_none=y` should disable stripping, but make the image way larger.
* `outputx86_64~/staging/` would be even better than `target/` as the docs say that this directory contains binaries before they were stripped. However, only a few binaries are pre-installed there by default, and it seems to be a manual per package thing.
+
E.g. `pciutils` has for `lspci`:
+
....
define PCIUTILS_INSTALL_STAGING_CMDS
    $(TARGET_MAKE_ENV) $(MAKE1) -C $(@D) $(PCIUTILS_MAKE_OPTS) \
        PREFIX=$(STAGING_DIR)/usr SBINDIR=$(STAGING_DIR)/usr/bin \
        install install-lib install-pcilib
endef
....
+
and the docs describe the `*_INSTALL_STAGING` per package config, which is normally set for shared library packages.
+

An implementation overview can be found at: https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/8829/cross-debugging-for-mips-elf-with-qemu-toolchain/16214#16214

=== gdbserver different archs

As usual, different archs work with:

....
./rungdbserver -a arm kernel_module-1.0/user/myinsmod.out
....

=== gdbserver BusyBox

BusyBox executables are all symlinks, so if you do on guest:

....
/gdbserver.sh ls
....

on host you need:

....
./rungdbserver busybox-1.26.2/busybox
....

=== gdbserver shared libraries

Our setup gives you the rare opportunity to step debug libc and other system libraries e.g. with:

....
b open
c
....

Or simply by stepping into calls:

....
s
....

This is made possible by the GDB command:

....
set sysroot ${buildroot_out_dir}/staging
....

which automatically finds unstripped shared libraries on the host for us.

See also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8611194/debugging-shared-libraries-with-gdbserver/45252113#45252113

=== Debug userland process without gdbserver

QEMU `-gdb` GDB breakpoints are set on virtual addresses, so you can in theory debug userland processes as well.

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26271901/is-it-possible-to-use-gdb-and-qemu-to-debug-linux-user-space-programs-and-kernel
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16273614/debug-init-on-qemu-using-gdb

The only use case I can see for this is to debug the init process (and have fun), otherwise, why wouldn't you just use `gdbserver`? Known limitations of direct userland debugging:

* the kernel might switch context to another process, and you would enter "garbage"
* TODO step into shared libraries. If I attempt to load them explicitly:
+
....
(gdb) sharedlibrary ../../staging/lib/libc.so.0
No loaded shared libraries match the pattern `../../staging/lib/libc.so.0'.
....
+
since GDB does not know that libc is loaded.

Custom init process:

* Shell 1:
+
....
./run -d -e 'init=/sleep_forever.out' -n
....
* Shell 2:
+
....
./rungdb-user kernel_module-1.0/user/sleep_forever.out main
....

BusyBox custom init process:

* Shell 1:
+
....
./run -d -e 'init=/bin/ls' -n
....
* Shell 2:
+
....
./rungdb-user -h busybox-1.26.2/busybox ls_main
....

This follows BusyBox' convention of calling the main for each executable as `<exec>_main` since the `busybox` executable has many "mains".

BusyBox default init process:

* Shell 1:
+
....
./run -d -n
....
* Shell 2:
+
....
./rungdb-user -h busybox-1.26.2/busybox init_main
....

This cannot be debugged in another way without modifying the source, or `/sbin/init` exits early with:

....
"must be run as PID 1"
....

Non-init process:

* Shell 1
+
....
./run -d -n
....
* Shell 2
+
....
./rungdb-user kernel_module-1.0/user/sleep_forever.out
Ctrl + C
b main
continue
....
* Shell 1
+
....
/sleep_forever.out
....

This is of least reliable setup as there might be other processes that use the given virtual address.

== Architectures

The portability of the kernel and toolchains is amazing: change an option and most things magically work on completely different hardware.

To use `arm` instead of x86 for example:

....
./build -a arm
./run -a arm
....

Debug:

....
./run -a arm -d
# On another terminal.
./rungdb -a arm
....

Known quirks of the supported architectures are documented in this section.

=== arm

TODOs:

* only managed to run in the terminal interface (but weirdly a blank QEMU window is still opened)
* GDB not connecting to KGDB. Possibly linked to `-serial stdio`. See also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14155577/how-to-use-kgdb-on-arm
* `/poweroff.out` does not exit QEMU nor gem5, the terminal just hangs: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31990487/how-to-cleanly-exit-qemu-after-executing-bare-metal-program-without-user-interve
+
A blunt resolution for QEMU is on host:
+
....
pkill qemu
....
+
On gem5, it is possible to use the `m5` instrumentation from guest as a good workaround:
+
....
m5 exit
....
* GDB step debugging of kernel modules broke at some point. This happens at 6420c31986e064c81561da8f2be0bd33483af598 on kernel v4.15, 6b0f89a8b43e8d33d3a3a436ed827f962da3008a v4.14 and 5ad68edd000685c016c45e344470f2c1867b8e39 v4.12 and also if kernel 4.9.6 is checked out. So maybe it was never working in the first place, but we never noticed?
+
Just after GDB connects, we get the following message from the kernel GDB Python scripts:
....
loading vmlinux
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/ciro/bak/git/linux-kernel-module-cheat/buildroot/output.arm~/build/linux-custom/scripts/gdb/linux/symbols.py", line 163, in invoke
    self.load_all_symbols()
  File "/home/ciro/bak/git/linux-kernel-module-cheat/buildroot/output.arm~/build/linux-custom/scripts/gdb/linux/symbols.py", line 150, in load_all_symbols
    [self.load_module_symbols(module) for module in module_list]
  File "/home/ciro/bak/git/linux-kernel-module-cheat/buildroot/output.arm~/build/linux-custom/scripts/gdb/linux/symbols.py", line 110, in load_module_symbols
    module_name = module['name'].string()
  File "/home/ciro/bak/git/linux-kernel-module-cheat/buildroot/output.arm~/host/lib/python2.7/encodings/utf_8.py", line 16, in decode
    return codecs.utf_8_decode(input, errors, True)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x9f in position 2: invalid start byte
Error occurred in Python command: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x9f in position 2: invalid start byte
....
+
and then after inserting the module, symbols are not found, presumably because `lx-symbols` never ran.

=== aarch64

As usual, we use Buildroot's recommended QEMU setup QEMU `aarch64` setup:

* https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot/blob/2017.08/board/qemu/aarch64-virt/readme.txt
* https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot/blob/2017.08/configs/qemu_aarch64_virt_defconfig

This makes aarch64 a bit different from `arm`:

* uses `-M virt`. https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Platforms/ARM explains:

Most of the machines QEMU supports have annoying limitations (small amount of RAM, no PCI or other hard disk, etc) which are there because that's what the real hardware is like. If you don't care about reproducing the idiosyncrasies of a particular bit of hardware, the best choice today is the "virt" machine.
____
+
`-M virt` has some limitations, e.g. I could not pass `-drive if=scsi` as for `arm`, and so <<Snapshot>> fails.
+
* uses <<initramfs>>, so thre is no filesystem persistency.

So, as long as you keep those points in mind, our `-a aarch64` offers an interesting different setup to play with.

TODOs:

* <<gdb>> appears to be stuck on an infinite loop:
+
....
no module object found for ''
....

=== mips64

Keep in mind that MIPS has the worst support compared to our other architectures due to the smaller community. Patches welcome as usual.

TODOs:

* networking is not working. See also:
** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21496449/networking-is-not-working-on-qemu-guest-malta-mips
** https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/208266/setting-up-qemu-and-mipsel-networking-trouble
** https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/354127/qemu-mips-and-debian
* <<gdb>> does not work properly, does not find `start_kernel`

== init

When the Linux kernel finishes booting, it runs an executable as the first and only userland process.

The default path is `/init`, but we an set a custom one with the `init=` <<kernel-command-line-parameters,kernel command line parameter>>.

This process is then responsible for setting up the entire userland (or destroying everything when you want to have fun).

This typically means reading some configuration files (e.g. `/etc/initrc`) and forking a bunch of userland executables based on those files.

systemd is a "popular" `/init` implementation for desktop distros as of 2017.

BusyBox provides its own minimalistic init implementation which Buildroot uses by default.

=== Custom init

Is the default BusyBox `/init` too bloated for you, minimalism freak?

No problem, just use the `init` kernel boot parameter:

....
./run -e 'init=/sleep_forever.out'
....

Remember that shell scripts can also be used for `init` https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/174062/init-as-a-shell-script/395375#395375:

....
./run -e 'init=/count.sh'
....

Also remember that if your init returns, the kernel will panic, there are just two non-panic possibilities:

* run forever in a loop or long sleep
* `poweroff` the machine

=== Disable networking

The default BusyBox init scripts enable networking, and there is a 15 second timeout in case your network is down or if your kernel / emulator setup does not support it.

To disable networking, use:

....
./build -p -n
....

To restore it, run:

....
./build -- initscripts-reconfigure
....

=== The init environment

The docs make it clear https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html

____
The kernel parses parameters from the kernel command line up to “–”; if it doesn’t recognize a parameter and it doesn’t contain a ‘.’, the parameter gets passed to init: parameters with ‘=’ go into init’s environment, others are passed as command line arguments to init. Everything after “–” is passed as an argument to init.
____

And you can try it out with:

....
./run -e 'init=/init_env_poweroff.sh - asdf=qwer zxcv' -n
....

== modprobe

If you are feeling fancy, you can also insert modules with:

....
modprobe dep2
lsmod
# dep and dep2
....

This method also deals with module dependencies, which we almost don't use to make examples simpler:

* https://askubuntu.com/questions/20070/whats-the-difference-between-insmod-and-modprobe
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22891705/whats-the-difference-between-insmod-and-modprobe

Removal also removes required modules that have zero usage count:

....
modprobe -r dep2
lsmod
# Nothing.
....

but it can't know if you actually insmodded them separately or not:

....
modprobe dep
modprobe dep2
modprobe -r dep2
# Nothing.
....

so it is a bit risky.

`modprobe` searches for modules under:

....
ls /lib/modules/*/extra/
....

Kernel modules built from the Linux mainline tree with `CONFIG_SOME_MOD=m`, are automatically available with `modprobe`, e.g.:

....
modprobe dummy-irq
....

== KVM

You can make QEMU or gem5 <<gem5-vs-qemu-performance,run faster>> by passing enabling KVM with:

....
./run -K
....

but it was broken in gem5 with pending patches: https://www.mail-archive.com/gem5-users@gem5.org/msg15046.html

KVM uses the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine[KVM Linux kernel feature] of the host to run most instructions natively.

We don't enable KVM by default because:

* only works if the architecture of the guest equals that of the host.
+
We have only tested / supported it on x86, but it is rumoured that QEMU and gem5 also have ARM KVM support if you are link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ItXpmLsINs[running an ARM desktop for some weird reason] :-)
* limits visibility, since more things are running natively:
** can't use GDB
** can't do instruction tracing
* kernel boots are already fast enough without `-enable-kvm`

The main use case for `-enable-kvm` in this repository is to test if something that takes a long time to run is functionally correct.

For example, when porting a benchmark to Buildroot, you can first use QEMU's KVM to test that benchmarks is producing the correct results, before analysing them more deeply in gem5, which runs much slower.

== X11

Only tested successfully in `x86_64`.

Build:

....
./build -i br2_x11
./run
....

We don't build X11 by default because it takes a considerable amount of time (~20%), and is not expected to be used by most users: you need to pass the `-x` flag to enable it.

Inside QEMU:

....
startx
....

image:x11.png[image]

More details: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/70931/how-to-install-x11-on-my-own-linux-buildroot-system/306116#306116

Not sure how well that graphics stack represents real systems, but if it does it would be a good way to understand how it works.

=== X11 ARM

On ARM, `startx` hangs at a message:

....
vgaarb: this pci device is not a vga device
....

and nothing shows on the screen, and:

....
grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log
....

says:

....
(EE) Failed to load module "modesetting" (module does not exist, 0)
....

A friend told me this but I haven't tried it yet:

* `xf86-video-modesetting` is likely the missing ingredient, but it does not seem possible to activate it from Buildroot currently without patching things.
* `xf86-video-fbdev` should work as well, but we need to make sure fbdev is enabled, and maybe add some line to the `Xorg.conf`

./run -a arm -g -E 'm5 exit'
# Or:
# ./run -a arm -g -E 'm5 exit' -- --cpu-type=HPI --caches
grep sim_insts m5out/stats.txt
....

Notes:

* `-n` is a good idea to reduce the chances that you send unwanted non-deterministic mouse or keyboard clicks to the VM.
* `-e 'init=/poweroff.out'` is crucial as it reduces the instruction count from 40 million to 20 million, so half of the instructions were due to userland programs instead of the boot sequence.
+
Without it, the bulk of the time seems to be spent in setting up the network with `ifup` that gets called from `/etc/init.d/S40network` from the default Buildroot BusyBox setup.
+
And it becomes even worse if you try to `-net none` as recommended in the 2.7 `replay.txt` docs, because then `ifup` waits for 15 seconds before giving up as per `/etc/network/interfaces` line `wait-delay 15`.
* `0x1000000` is the address where QEMU puts the Linux kernel at with `-kernel` in x86.
+
It can be found from:
+
....
readelf -e buildroot/output.x86_64~/build/linux-*/vmlinux | grep Entry
....
+
TODO confirm further. If I try to break there with:
+
....
./rungdb *0x1000000
....
+
but I have no corresponding source line. Also note that this line is not actually the first line, since the kernel messages such as `early console in extract_kernel` have already shown on screen at that point. This does not break at all:
+
....
./rungdb extract_kernel
....
+
It only appears once on every log I've seen so far, checked with `grep 0x1000000 trace.txt`
+
Then when we count the instructions that run before the kernel entry point, there is only about 100k instructions, which is insignificant compared to the kernel boot itself.
* We can also discount the instructions after `init` runs by using `readelf` to get the initial address of `init`. One easy way to do that now is to just run:
+
....
./rungdb-user kernel_module-1.0/user/poweroff.out main
....
+
And get that from the traces, e.g. if the address is `4003a0`, then we search:
+
....
grep -n 4003a0 trace.txt
....
+
I have observed a single match for that instruction, so it must be the init, and there were only 20k instructions after it, so the impact is negligible.
* gem5 simulates memory latencies. So I think that the CPU loops idle while waiting for memory, and counts will be higher.

This works because we have already done the following with QEMU:

* `./configure --enable-trace-backends=simple`. This logs in a binary format to the trace file.
+
It makes 3x execution faster than the default trace backend which logs human readable data to stdout.
+
This also alters the actual execution, and reduces the instruction count by 10M TODO understand exactly why, possibly due to the `All QSes seen` thing.
* patch  QEMU source to remove the `disable` from `exec_tb` in the `trace-events`. See also: https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/tracing-qemu-guest-execution/

Possible improvements:

* to disable networking. Is replacing `init` enough?
** https://superuser.com/questions/181254/how-do-you-boot-linux-with-networking-disabled
** https://superuser.com/questions/684005/how-does-one-permanently-disable-gnu-linux-networking/1255015#1255015
+
`CONFIG_NET=n` did not significantly reduce instruction, so maybe replacing `init` is enough.
* logging with the default backend `log` greatly slows down the CPU, and in particular leads to this during kernel boot:
+
....
All QSes seen, last rcu_sched kthread activity 5252 (4294901421-4294896169), jiffies_till_next_fqs=1, root ->qsmask 0x0

....
+
in which the boot appears to hang for a considerable time.
* Confirm that the kernel enters at `0x1000000`, or where it enters. Once we have this, we can exclude what comes before in the BIOS.

== initrd

The kernel can boot from an CPIO file, which is a directory serialization format much like tar: https://superuser.com/questions/343915/tar-vs-cpio-what-is-the-difference

The bootloader, which for us is QEMU itself, is then configured to put that CPIO into memory, and tell the kernel that it is there.

With this setup, you don't even need to give a root filesystem to the kernel, it just does everything in memory in a ramfs.

Try it out with:

....
./run -i
....

Notice how it boots fine, even though `-drive` is not given.

Also as expected, there is no filesystem persistency, since we are doing everything in memory:

....
date >f
poweroff
cat f
# can't open 'f': No such file or directory
....

This can be good for automated tests, as it ensures that you are using a pristine unmodified system image every time.

The main ingredients to get this working are:

* `BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_CPIO=y`: make Buildroot generate `output/images/rootfs.cpio` in addition to the other images.
+
It is also possible to compress that image with other options.
* `qemu -initrd`: make QEMU put the image into memory and tell the kernel about it.
* `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y`: Compile the kernel with initrd support, see also: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/67462/linux-kernel-is-not-finding-the-initrd-correctly/424496#424496
+
Buildroot forces that option when `BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_CPIO=y` is given

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/89923/how-does-linux-load-the-initrd-image asks how the mechanism works in more detail.

=== initrd in desktop distros

Most modern desktop distributions have an initrd in their root disk to do early setup.

The rationale for this is described at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk

One obvious use case is having an encrypted root filesystem: you keep the initrd in an unencrypted partition, and then setup decryption from there.

I think GRUB then knows read common disk formats, and then loads that initrd to memory with a `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` directive of type:

    initrd /initrd.img-4.4.0-108-generic

Related: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6405083/initrd-and-booting-the-linux-kernel

=== initramfs

initramfs is just like <<initrd>>, but you also glue the image directly to the kernel image itself.

So the only argument that QEMU needs is the `-kernel`, no `-drive` not even `-initrd`! Pretty cool.

Try it out with:

....
./run -a aarch64
....

since our <<aarch64>> setup uses it by default.

In the background, it uses `BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_INITRAMFS`, and this makes the kernel config option `CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE` point to the CPIO that will be embedded in the kernel image.

http://nairobi-embedded.org/initramfs_tutorial.html shows a full manual setup.

== Linux kernel

=== Use your own kernel config

By default, we use a `.config` that is a mixture of:

* Buildroot's minimal per machine `.config`, which has the minimal options needed to boot
* our link:kernel_config_fragment[] which enables options we want to play with

If you want to just use your own exact `.config` instead, do:

....
./build -K myconfig -l
....

Beware that Buildroot can `sed` override some of the configurations we make no matter what, e.g. it forces `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y` when `BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_CPIO` is on, so you might want to double check as explained at <<find-the-kernel-config>>. TODO check if there is a way to prevent that patching and maybe patch Buildroot for it, it is too fuzzy. People should be able to just build with whatever `.config` they want.

=== Find the kernel config

Build configuration can be observed in guest with:

....
/conf.sh
....

or on host:

....
cat buildroot/output.*~/build/linux-custom/.config
....

=== Find the kernel version

We try to use the latest possible kernel major release version.

In QEMU:

....
cat /proc/version
....

or in the source:

....
cd linux
git log | grep -E '    Linux [0-9]+\.' | head
....

=== ftrace

Trace a single function:

....
cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/

# Stop tracing.
echo 0 > tracing_on

# Clear previous trace.
echo '' > trace

# List the available tracers, and pick one.
cat available_tracers
echo function > current_tracer

# List all functions that can be traced
# cat available_filter_functions
# Choose one.
echo __kmalloc >set_ftrace_filter
# Confirm that only __kmalloc is enabled.
cat enabled_functions

echo 1 > tracing_on

# Latest events.
head trace

# Observe trace continously, and drain seen events out.
cat trace_pipe &
....

== QEMU

Some QEMU specific features to play with and limitations to cry over.

=== Snapshot

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40227651/does-qemu-emulator-have-checkpoint-function/48724371#48724371

QEMU allows us to take snapshots at any time through the monitor.

You can then restore CPU, memory and disk state back at any time.

qcow2 filesystems must be used for that to work.

To test it out, login into the VM with and run:

....
/count.sh
....

On another shell, take a snapshot:

....
echo 'savevm my_snap_id' | ./qemumonitor
....

The counting continues.

Restore the snapshot:

....
echo 'loadvm  my_snap_id' | ./qemumonitor
....

and the counting goes back to where we saved. This shows that CPU and memory states were reverted.

We can also verify that the disk state is also reversed. Guest:

....
echo 0 >f
....

Monitor:

....
echo 'savevm my_snap_id' | ./qemumonitor
....

Guest:

....
echo 1 >f
....

Monitor:

....
echo 'loadvm my_snap_id' | ./qemumonitor
....

Guest:

....
cat f
....

And the output is `0`.

Our setup does not allow for snapshotting while using <<initrd>>.

=== Educational hardware models

We have added and interacted with a few educational hardware models in QEMU.

This is useful to learn:

* how to create new hardware models for QEMU. Overview: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28315265/how-to-add-a-new-device-in-qemu-source-code
* how the Linux kernel interacts with hardware

To get started, have a look at the "Hardware device drivers" section under link:kernel_module/README.adoc[], and try to run those modules, and then grep the QEMU source code.

=== 9P

This protocol allows sharing a mountable filesystem between guest and host.

With networking, it's boring, we can just use any of the old tools like sshfs and NFS.

https://superuser.com/questions/628169/how-to-share-a-directory-with-the-host-without-networking-in-qemu

One advantage of this method over NFS is that can run without `sudo` on host, or having to pass host credentials on guest for sshfs.

TODO performance compared to NFS.

As usual, we have already set everything up for you. On host:

....
cd 9p
uname -a > host
....

Guest:

....
cd /mnt/9p
cat host
uname -a > guest
....

Host:

....
cat guest
....

The main ingredients for this are:

* `9P` settings in our link:kernel_config_fragment[]
* `9p` entry on our link:rootfs_overlay/etc/fstab[]
+
Alternatively, you could also mount your own with:
+
....
mkdir /mnt/my9p
mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L host0 /mnt/my9p
....
* Launch QEMU with `-virtfs` as in your link:run[] script
+
When we tried:
+
....
security_model=mapped
....

writes from guest failed due to user mismatch problems: https://serverfault.com/questions/342801/read-write-access-for-passthrough-9p-filesystems-with-libvirt-qemu

The feature is documented at: https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/9psetup

==== 9P gem5

Seems possible! Lets do it:

* http://gem5.org/wiki/images/b/b8/Summit2017_wa_devlib.pdf
* http://gem5.org/WA-gem5

=== Guest host networking

==== Host to guest

Guest, BusyBox `nc` enabled with `CONFIG_NC=y`:

....
nc -l -p 45455
....

Host, `nc` from the `netcat-openbsd` package:

....
echo asdf | nc localhost 45455
....

Then `asdf` appears on the guest.

Only this specific port works by default since we have forwarded it on the QEMU command line.

We us this exact procedure to connect to <<gdbserver>>.

===== ssh into guest

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/124681/how-to-ssh-from-host-to-guest-using-qemu/307557#307557

Uses OpenSSH's `sshd`.

Not enabled by default due to the build / runtime overhead, but it was tested and worked at the time of this commit.

==== Guest to host

TODO. There is `guestfwd`, which sounds analogous to `hostwfd` used in the other sense, but I was not able to get it working, e.g.:

....
-netdev user,hostfwd=tcp::45455-:45455,guestfwd=tcp::45456-,id=net0 \
....

gives:

....
Could not open guest forwarding device 'guestfwd.tcp.45456'
....

=== QEMU user mode

This has nothing to do with the Linux kernel, but it is cool:

....
sudo apt-get install qemu-user
./build -a arm
cd buildroot/output.arm~/target
qemu-arm -L . bin/ls
....

This uses QEMU's user-mode emulation mode that allows us to run cross-compiled userland programs directly on the host.

The reason this is cool, is that `ls` is not statically compiled, but since we have the Buildroot image, we are still able to find the shared linker and the shared library at the given path.

In other words, much cooler than:

....
arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -o hello -static hello.c
qemu-arm hello
....

It is also possible to compile QEMU user mode from source with `BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_QEMU_LINUX_USER_MODE=y`, but then your compilation will likely fail with:

....
package/qemu/qemu.mk:110: *** "Refusing to build qemu-user: target Linux version newer than host's.".  Stop.
....

since we are using a bleeding edge kernel, which is a sanity check in the Buildroot QEMU package.

Anyways, this warns us that the userland emulation will likely not be reliable, which is good to know. TODO: where is it documented the host kernel must be as new as the target one?

GDB step debugging is also possible with:

....
qemu-arm -g 1234 -L . bin/ls
../host/usr/bin/arm-buildroot-linux-uclibcgnueabi-gdb -ex 'target remote localhost:1234'
....

TODO: find source. Lazy now.

=== Debug QEMU

When you start interacting with QEMU hardware, it is useful to see what is going on inside of QEMU itself.

This is of course trivial since QEMU is just an userland program on the host, but we make it a bit easier with:

....
./run -D
....

Then you could:

....
b edu_mmio_read
c
....

And in QEMU:

....
/pci.sh
....

Just make sure that you never click inside the QEMU window when doing that, otherwise you mouse gets captured forever, and the only solution I can find is to go to a TTY with Ctrl + Alt + F1 and `kill` QEMU.

You can still send key presses to QEMU however even without the mouse capture, just either click on the title bar, or alt tab to give it focus.

=== QEMU GUI is unresponsive

Sometimes in Ubuntu 14.04, after the QEMU SDL GUI starts, it does not get updated after keyboard strokes, and there are artifacts like disappearing text.

We have not managed to track this problem down yet, but the following workaround always works:

....
Ctrl + Shift + U
Ctrl + C
root
....

This started happening when we switched to building QEMU through Buildroot, and has not been observed on later Ubuntu.

Using text mode is another workaround if you don't need GUI features.

== gem5

=== gem5 getting started

gem5 is a system simulator, much <<gem5-vs-qemu,like QEMU>>: http://gem5.org/

For the most part, just add the `-g` option to the QEMU commands and everything should magically work:

....
./configure -gq && ./build -a arm -g
./run -a arm -g
....

On another shell:

....
./gem5-shell
....

A full rebuild is currently needed even if you already have QEMU working unfortunately, see: <<gem5-and-qemu-with-the-same-kernel-configuration>>

Tested architectures:

* `arm`
* `aarch64`
* `x86_64`

Like QEMU, gem5 also has a syscall emulation mode (SE), but in this tutorial we focus on the full system emulation mode (FS). For a comparison see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48986597/when-should-you-use-full-system-fs-vs-syscall-emulation-se-with-userland-program

=== gem5 vs QEMU

* advantages of gem5:
** simulates a generic more realistic pipelined and optionally out of order CPU cycle by cycle, including a realistic DRAM memory access model with latencies, caches and page table manipulations. This allows us to:
*** do much more realistic performance benchmarking with it, which makes absolutely no sense in QEMU, which is purely functional
*** make certain functional cache observations that are not possible in QEMU, e.g.:
**** use Linux kernel APIs that flush memory like DMA, which are crucial for driver development. In QEMU, the driver would still work even if we forget to flush caches.
**** TODO spectre / meltdown
+
It is not of course truly cycle accurate, as that
** would require exposing proprietary information of the CPU designs: link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17454955/can-you-check-performance-of-a-program-running-with-qemu-simulator/33580850#33580850[]
** would make the simulation even slower TODO confirm, by how much
+
but the approximation is reasonable.
+
It is used mostly for microarchitecture research purposes: when you are making a new chip technology, you don't really need to specialize enormously to an existing microarchitecture, but rather develop something that will work with a wide range of future architectures.
** runs are deterministic by default, unlike QEMU which has a special <<record-and-replay>> mode, that requires first playing the content once and then replaying
* disadvantage of gem5: slower than QEMU, see: <<gem5-vs-qemu-performance>>
+
This implies that the user base is much smaller, since no Android devs.
+
Instead, we have only chip makers, who keep everything that really works closed, and researchers, who can't version track or document code properly >:-) And this implies that:
+
--
** the documentation is more scarce
** it takes longer to support new hardware features
--
+
Well, not that AOSP is that much better anyways.
* not sure: gem5 has BSD license while QEMU has GPL
+
This suits chip makers that want to distribute forks with secret IP to their customers.
+
On the other hand, the chip makers tend to upstream less, and the project becomes more crappy in average :-)

==== gem5 vs QEMU performance

We have benchmarked a Linux kernel boot at commit da79d6c6cde0fbe5473ce868c9be4771160a003b with the commands:

....
# Try to manually hit Ctrl + C as soon as system shutdown message appears.
time ./run -a arm -e 'init=/poweroff.out'
time ./run -a arm -e 'm5 exit' -g
time ./run -a arm -e 'm5 exit' -g -- --caches --cpu-type=HPI
time ./run -a x86_64 -e 'init=/poweroff.out'
time ./run -a x86_64 -e 'init=/poweroff.out' -- -enable-kvm
time ./run -a x86_64 -e 'init=/poweroff.out' -g
....

and the results were:

[options="header"]
|===
|Emulator |Time |N times slower than QEMU
|QEMU ARM |6 seconds |1
|gem5 ARM AtomicSimpleCPU |1 minute 40 seconds| 17
|gem5 ARM HPI |10 minutes |100
|QEMU X86_64 |4 seconds |1
|QEMU X86_64 KVM |2 seconds |0.5
|gem5 X86_64 |5 minutes 30 seconds| 82
|===

tested on the <<p51>>.

=== gem5 run benchmark

OK, this is why we used gem5 in the first place, performance measurements!

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48944587/how-to-count-the-number-of-cpu-clock-cycles-between-the-start-and-end-of-a-bench

Let's benchmark https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone[Dhrystone] which Buildroot provides:

....
./gem5-bench dhrystone 1000
./gem5-bench -r dhrystone 1000
....

These commands output the approximate number of CPU cycles it took Dhrystone to run.

It works like this:

* the first command boots linux with the default simplified `AtomicSimpleCPU`, and generates a <<gem5-checkpoint,checkpoint>> after the kernel boots and before running the benchmark
* the second command restores the checkpoint with the more detailed `HPI` CPU model, and runs the benchmark. We don't boot with it because that is much slower.

ARM employees have just been modifying benchmarking code with instrumentation directly: https://github.com/arm-university/arm-gem5-rsk/blob/aa3b51b175a0f3b6e75c9c856092ae0c8f2a7cdc/parsec_patches/xcompile-patch.diff#L230

A few imperfections of our benchmarking method are:

* when we do `m5 resetstats` and `m5 exit`, there is some time passed before the `exec` system call returns and the actual benchmark starts and ends
* the benchmark outputs to stdout, which means so extra cycles in addition to the actual computation. But TODO: how to get the output to check that it is correct without such IO cycles?

Those problems should be insignificant if the benchmark runs for long enough however.

TODO: even if we don't switch to the detailed CPU model, the cycle counts on the original run and the one with checkpoint restore differ slightly. Why? Multiple checkpoint restores give the same results as expected however:

....
./run -a arm -E 'm5 checkpoint;m5 resetstats;dhrystone 1000;m5 exit' -g
./run -a arm -g -- -r 1
....

Now you can play a fun little game with your friends:

* pick a computational problem
* make a program that solves the computation problem, and outputs output to stdout
* write the code that runs the correct computation in the smallest number of cycles possible

To find out why your program is slow, a good first step is to have a look at the statistics for the run:

....
cat m5out/stats.txt
....

Whenever we run `m5 dumpstats` or `m5 exit`, a section with the following format is added to that file:

....
---------- Begin Simulation Statistics ----------
[the stats]
---------- End Simulation Statistics   ----------
....

==== gem5 system parameters

Besides optimizing a program for a given CPU setup, chip developers can also do the inverse, and optimize the chip for a given benchmark!

The rabbit hole is likely deep, but let's scratch a bit of the surface.

===== gem5 number of cores

....
./run -a arm -c 2 -g
....

Check with:

....
cat /proc/cpuinfo
getconf _NPROCESSORS_CONF
....

===== gem5 cache size

A quick `+./run -g -- -h+` leads us to the options:

....
--caches
--l1d_size=1024
--l1i_size=1024
--l2cache
--l2_size=1024
--l3_size=1024
....

But keep in mind that it only affects benchmark performance of the most detailed CPU types:

[options="header"]
|===
|arch |CPU type |caches used
|X86 |`AtomicSimpleCPU` | no
|X86 |`DerivO3CPU` | ?*
|ARM |`AtomicSimpleCPU` | no
|ARM |`HPI` | yes
|===

{empty}*: couldn't test because of:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49011096/how-to-switch-cpu-models-in-gem5-after-restoring-a-checkpoint-and-then-observe-t
* https://github.com/gem5/gem5/issues/16

This has been verified with:

....
m5 resetstats && dhrystone 10000 && m5 dumpstats
....

at commit da79d6c6cde0fbe5473ce868c9be4771160a003b with the following gem5 commands cycle counts:

....
# 11M
./run -a arm -g
./run -a arm -g -- --caches --l2cache

# 175M
./run -a arm -g -- --caches --l1d_size=1024   --l1i_size=1024   --l2cache --l2_size=1024   --l3_size=1024   --cpu-type=HPI

# 16M
./run -a arm -g -- --caches --l1d_size=1024MB --l1i_size=1024MB --l2cache --l2_size=1024MB --l3_size=1024MB --cpu-type=HPI

# 20M
./run -a x86_64 -g -- --caches --l1d_size=1024 --l2cache --l2_size=1024 --l3_size=1024
./run -a x86_64 -g -- --caches --l1d_size=1024MB --l2cache --l2_size=1024MB --l3_size=1024MB
....

Cache sizes can in theory be checked with the methods described at: link:https://superuser.com/questions/55776/finding-l2-cache-size-in-linux[]:

....
getconf -a | grep CACHE
lscpu
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index2/size
....

but for some reason the Linux kernel is not seeing the cache sizes:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49008792/why-doesnt-the-linux-kernel-see-the-cache-sizes-in-the-gem5-emulator-in-full-sy
* http://gem5-users.gem5.narkive.com/4xVBlf3c/verify-cache-configuration

Behaviour breakdown:

* arm QEMU and gem5 (both `AtomicSimpleCPU` or `HPI`), x86 gem5: `/sys` files don't exist, and `getconf` and `lscpu` value empty
* x86 QEMU: `/sys` files exist, but `getconf` and `lscpu` values still empty

===== gem5 memory latency

TODO These look promising:

....
--list-mem-types
--mem-type=MEM_TYPE
--mem-channels=MEM_CHANNELS
--mem-ranks=MEM_RANKS
--mem-size=MEM_SIZE
....

TODO: now to verify this with the Linux kernel? Besides raw performance benchmarks.

===== gem5 disk and network latency

TODO These look promising:

....
--ethernet-linkspeed
--ethernet-linkdelay
....

and also: `gem5-dist`: https://publish.illinois.edu/icsl-pdgem5/

===== gem5 clock frequency

Clock frequency: TODO how does it affect performance in benchmarks?

....
./run -a arm -g -- --cpu-clock 10000000
....

Check with:

....
m5 resetstats && sleep 10 && m5 dumpstats
....

and then:

....
grep numCycles m5out/stats.txt
....

TODO: why doesn't this exist:

....
ls /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq
....

==== Enable compiler optimizations

If you are benchmarking compiled programs instead of hand written assembly, remember that we configure Buildroot to disable optimizations by default with:

....
BR2_OPTIMIZE_0=y
....

to improve the debugging experience.

You will likely want to change that to:

....
BR2_OPTIMIZE_3=y
....

and do a full rebuild.

TODO is it possible to compile a single package with optimizations enabled? In any case, this wouldn't be very representative, since calls to an unoptimized libc will also have an impact on performance. Kernel-wise it should be fine though, since the kernel requires `O=2`.

==== Interesting benchmarks

Buildroot built-in libraries, mostly under Libraries > Other:

* Armadillo `C++`: linear algebra
* fftw: Fourier transform
* Eigen: linear algebra
* Flann
* GSL: various
* liblinear
* libspacialindex
* libtommath
* qhull

There are not yet enabled, but it should be easy to so:

* enable them in link:br2[] and rebuild
* create a test program that uses each library under link:kernel_module/user[]

External open source benchmarks. We will try to create Buildroot packages for them, add them to this repo, and potentially upstream:

* http://parsec.cs.princeton.edu/ Mentioned on docs: http://gem5.org/PARSEC_benchmarks
* http://www.m5sim.org/Splash_benchmarks

===== BLAS

Buildroot supports it, which makes everything just trivial:

....
printf 'BR2_PACKAGE_OPENBLAS=y\n' >> br2_local
printf 'BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_SIZE="128M"\n' >> br2_local
./build -a arm -g -i br2_local -- kernel_module-reconfigure
....

and then inside the guest run our test program:

....
/openblas.out
....

For x86, you also need:

....
printf 'BR2_PACKAGE_OPENBLAS_TARGET="NEHALEM"\n' >> br2_local
....

to overcome this bug: https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=10856

....
sgemm_kernel.o: No such file or directory
....

===== PARSEC benchmark

We have ported parts of the link:http://parsec.cs.princeton.edu[PARSEC benchmark] for cross compilation at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/parsec-benchmark See the documentation on that repo to find out which benchmarks have been ported. Furthermore, some of the benchmarks were are segfaulting, see link:parsec-benchmark/test.sh[]

There are two ways to run PARSEC with this repo:

* <<parsec-benchmark-without-parsecmgmt,without `pasecmgmt`>>, most likely what you want
* <<parsec-benchmark-with-parsecmgmt,with `pasecmgmt`>>

====== PARSEC benchmark without parsecmgmt

....
configure -gpq && ./build -a arm -g -i br2_parsec
./run -a arm -g
....

Once inside the guest, launch one of the `test` input sized benchmarks manually as in:

....
cd /parsec/ext/splash2x/apps/fmm/run
../inst/arm-linux.gcc/bin/fmm 1 < input_1
....

To find out how to run many of the benchmarks, you can either:

* have a look at: link:parsec-benchmark/test.sh[]
* do a search on the build stdout on your terminal for a line of type:
+
....
Running /parsec/ext/splash2x/apps/fmm/inst/arm-linux.gcc/bin/fmm 1 < input_1:
....
+
Yes, we do run the benchmarks on host just to unpack / generate inputs... and they almost always fail to run since they were build for the guest instead of host. Hopefully, since we don't want to wait for them to finish anyways.
* have a quick peak at the package sources, usually `src/run.sh` and `parsec/*.runconf`.

PARSEC simply wasn't designed with non native machines in mind.

Running a benchmark of a different size requires a rebuild wit:

....
./build \
  -a arm \
  -c 'BR2_PACKAGE_PARSEC_BENCHMARK_INPUT_SIZE="simsmall"' \
  -c BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_SIZE="500M" \
  -g \
  -i br2_parsec \
  -- parsec-benchmark-reconfigure \
;
....

and then try running the benchmarks as before.

The rebuild is required because some of the input sizes

Separating input sizes also allows to create smaller images when only running the smaller benchmarks.

We don't have a perfect way to find the right value for `BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_SIZE`, one good heuristic is:

....
du -hsx buildroot/output.arm-gem5~/target/parsec
....

Also dots cannot be used as in `1.5G`, so just use Megs as in `1500M` instead.

If you don't set it high enough, you will get the message:

....
Maybe you need to increase the filesystem size (BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_SIZE)
....

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49211241/is-there-a-way-to-automatically-detect-the-minimum-required-br2-target-rootfs-ex

TODO: mount the benchmarks from host instead of installing them on guest. <<9p>> would be perfect for this, but we need to get it working on gem5 and arm first.

====== PARSEC benchmark with parsecmgmt

Most users won't want to use this method because:

* running the `parsecmgmt` Bash scripts takes forever before it ever starts running the actual benchmarks on gem5
+
Running on QEMU is feasible, but not the main use case, since QEMU cannot be used for performance measurements
* it requires putting the full `.tar` inputs on the guest, which makes the image twice as large (1x for the `.tar`, 1x for the unpacked input files)

It would be awesome if it were possible to use this method, since this is what Parsec supports officially, and so:

* you don't have to dig into what raw command to run
* there is an easy way to run all the benchmarks in one go to test them out
* you can just run any of the benchmarks that you want

but it simply is not feasible in gem5 because it takes too long.

If you still want to run this, try it out with:

....
./build -a arm \
  -c BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_SIZE="3G" \
  -g
  -i br2_parsec
  -- parsec-benchmark-reconfigure \
;
....

And then you can run it just as you would on the host:

....
cd /parsec/
bash
. env.sh
parsecmgmt -a run -p splash2x.fmm -i test
....

====== PARSEC change the input size

One limitation is that only one input size is available on the guest for a given build.

To change that, edit link:br2_parsec[] to contain for example:

....
BR2_PACKAGE_PARSEC_BENCHMARK_INPUT_SIZE=simsmall
....

and then rebuild with:

....
./build -a arm -g -i br2_parsec -- parsec-benchmark-reconfigure
....

This limitation exists because `parsecmgmt` generates the input files just before running via the Bash scripts, but we can't run `parsecmgmt` on gem5 as it is too slow!

One option would be to do that inside the guest with QEMU, but this would required a full rebuild due to <<gem5-and-qemu-with-the-same-kernel-configuration>>.

Also, we can't generate all input sizes at once, because many of them have the same name and would overwrite one another... Parsec clearly needs a redesign for embedded, maybe we will patch it later.

====== PARSEC uninstall

If you want to remove PARSEC later, Buildroot doesn't provide an automated package removal mechanism as documented at: link:https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot/blob/2017.08/docs/manual/rebuilding-packages.txt#L90[], but the following procedure should be satisfactory:

....
rm -rf \
  ./buildroot/dl/parsec-* \
  ./buildroot/output.arm-gem5~/build/parsec-* \
  ./buildroot/output.arm-gem5~/build/packages-file-list.txt \
  ./buildroot/output.arm-gem5~/images/rootfs.* \
  ./buildroot/output.arm-gem5~/target/parsec-* \
;
./build -a arm -g
....

====== PARSEC benchmark hacking

If you end up going inside link:parsec-benchmark/parsec-benchmark[] to hack up the benchmark (you will!), these tips will be helpful.

Buildroot was not designed to deal with large images, and currently cross rebuilds are a bit slow, due to some image generation and validation steps.

A few workarounds are:

* develop in host first as much as you can. Our PARSEC fork supports it.
+
If you do this, don't forget to do a:
+
....
cd parsec-benchmark/parsec-benchmark
git clean -xdf .
....
before going for the cross compile build.
+
* patch Buildroot to work well, and keep cross compiling all the way. This should be totally viable, and we should do it.
+
Don't forget to explicitly rebuild PARSEC with:
+
....
./build -a arm -g -i br2_parsec parsec-benchmark-reconfigure
....
+
You may also want to test if your patches are still functionally correct inside of QEMU first, which is a faster emulator.
* sell your soul, and compile natively inside the guest. We won't do this, not only because it is evil, but also because Buildroot explicitly does not support it: https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#faq-no-compiler-on-target ARM employees have been known to do this: https://github.com/arm-university/arm-gem5-rsk/blob/aa3b51b175a0f3b6e75c9c856092ae0c8f2a7cdc/parsec_patches/qemu-patch.diff

TODO Buildroot is slow because of the `pkg-generic` `GLOBAL_INSTRUMENTATION_HOOKS` sanitation which go over the entire tree doing complex operations... I no like, in particular `check_bin_arch` and `check_host_rpath`.

The pause is followed by:

....
buildroot/output.arm~/build/parsec-benchmark-custom/.stamp_target_installed
....

so which shows that the whole delay is inside our install itself.

I put an `echo f` in `check_bin_arch`, and it just loops forever, does not stop on a particular package.

=== gem5 kernel command line parameters

Analogous <<kernel-command-line-parameters,to QEMU>>:

....
./run -a arm -e 'init=/poweroff.out' -g
....

Internals: when we give `--command-line=` to gem5, it overrides default command lines, including some mandatory ones which are required to boot properly.

Our run script hardcodes the require options in the default `--command-line` and appends extra options given by `-e`.

To find the default options in the first place, we removed `--command-line` and ran:

....
./run -a arm -g
....

and then looked at the line of the Linux kernel that starts with:

....
Kernel command line:
....

[[gem5-gdb]]
=== gem5 GDB step debugging

Analogous <<gdb,to QEMU>>, on the first shell:

....
./run -a arm -d -g
....

On the second shell:

....
./rungdb -a arm -g
....

This makes the VM stop, so from inside GDB:

....
continue
....

On a third shell:

....
./gem5-shell
....

And we now see the boot messages, and then get a shell. Now try the `/continue.sh` procedure described for QEMU.

TODO: how to stop at `start_kernel`? gem5 listens for GDB by default, and therefore does not wait for a GDB connection to start like QEMU does. So when GDB connects we might have already passed `start_kernel`. Maybe `--debug-break=0` can be used?

=== gem5 checkpoint

Analogous to QEMU's <<snapshot>>, but better since it can be started from inside the guest, so we can easily checkpoint after a specific guest event, e.g. just before `init` is done.

Documentation: http://gem5.org/Checkpoints

....
./run -a arm -g
....

In the guest, wait for the boot to end and run:

....
m5 checkpoint
....

To restore the checkpoint, kill the VM and run:

....
./run -a arm -g -- -r 1
....

Let's create a second checkpoint to see how it works, in guest:

....
date >f
m5 checkpoint
....

Kill the VM, and try it out:

....
./run -a arm -g -- -r 2
....

and now in the guest:

....
cat f
....

contains the `date`. The file `f` wouldn't exist had we used the first checkpoint with `-r 1`.

If you automate things with <<kernel-command-line-parameters>> as in:

....
./run -a arm -E 'm5 checkpoint;m5 resetstats;dhrystone 1000;m5 exit' -g
....

Then there is no need to pass the kernel command line again to gem5 for replay:

....
./run -a arm -g -- -r 1
....

since boot has already happened, and the parameters are already in the RAM of the snapshot.

Our scripts "namespace" with the checkpoint by architecture with `--checkpoint-dir`, so if you make two checkpoints:

* one in x86
* the other in arm

Then you would still restore both of them with `-- -r 1`.

This makes it easier to remember which checkpoint is which, especially since there appears to be no runtime way to set the checkpoint names.

Internals:

* the checkpoints are stored under `m5out/cpts/$arch/cpt.$todo_whatisthis`
* `m5` is a guest utility present inside the gem5 tree which we cross-compiled and installed into the guest

==== gem5 restore checkpoint with a different CPU

gem5 can switch to a different CPU model when restoring a checkpoint.

A common combo is to boot Linux with a fast CPU, make a checkpoint and then replay the benchmark of interest with a slower CPU.

An illustrative interactive run:

....
./run -a arm -g
....

In guest:

....
m5 checkpoint
....

And then restore the checkpoint with a different CPU:

....
./run -a arm -g -- --caches -r 1 --restore-with-cpu=HPI
....

=== Pass extra options to gem5

Pass options to the `fs.py` script:

* get help:
+
....
./run -g -- -h
....
* boot with the more detailed and slow `HPI` CPU model:
+
....
./run -a arm -g -- --caches --cpu-type=HPI
....

Pass options to the `gem5` executable itself:

* get help:
+
....
./run -G '-h' -g
....

=== Run multiple gem5 instances at once

gem5 just assigns new ports if some ports are occupied, so we can do:

....
./run -g
# Same as ./gem5-shell 0
./gem5-shell
....

And a second instance:

....
./run -g
./gem5-shell 1
....

TODO Now we just need to network them up to have some more fun! See dist-gem5: http://publish.illinois.edu/icsl-pdgem5/

=== gem5 and QEMU with the same kernel configuration

We would like to be able to run both gem5 and QEMU with the same kernel build to avoid duplication, but TODO we haven't been able to get that working yet.

This documents our failed attempts so far.

As a result, we currently have to create two full `buildroot/output*` directories, which means two full GCC builds.

==== QEMU with gem5 kernel configuration

To test this, hack up `run` to use the `buildroot/output.arm-gem5~` directory, and then run:

....
./run -a arm
....

Now QEMU hangs at:

....
audio: Could not init `oss' audio driver
....

and the display shows:

....
Guest has not initialized the display (yet).
....

==== gem5 with QEMU kernel configuration

Test it out with:

....
./run -a arm -g
....

TODO hangs at:

....
**** REAL SIMULATION ****
warn: Existing EnergyCtrl, but no enabled DVFSHandler found.
info: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...
1614868500: system.terminal: attach terminal 0
....

and the `telnet` at:

....
$ ./gem5-shell
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
==== m5 slave terminal: Terminal 0 ====
....

I have also tried to copy the exact same kernel command line options used by QEMU, but nothing changed.

=== gem5 limitations

* networking not working. We currently just disable it from `inittab` by default to prevent waiting at startup
* `gdbserver`: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48941494/how-to-do-port-forwarding-from-guest-to-host-in-gem5

==== gem5 x86_64 limitations

* `gdb` debugging not working. First we need to remove the initial `set arch i386:x86-64:intel` required for QEMU. Then it cannot find the symbols.

== Failed action

=== Record and replay

QEMU supports deterministic record and replay by saving external inputs, which would be awesome to understand the kernel, as you would be able to examine a single run as many times as you would like.

Unfortunately it is not working in the current QEMU: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46970215/how-to-use-qemus-deterministic-record-and-replay-feature-for-a-linux-kernel-boo

Alternatively, https://github.com/mozilla/rr[`mozilla/rr`] claims it is able to run QEMU: but using it would require you to step through QEMU code itself. Likely doable, but do you really want to?

== Insane action

=== Run on host

This method runs the kernel modules directly on your host computer without a VM, and saves you the compilation time and disk usage of the virtual machine method.

It has however severe limitations, and you will soon see that the compilation time and disk usage are well worth it:

* can't control which kernel version and build options to use. So some of the modules will likely not compile because of kernel API changes, since https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37098482/how-to-build-a-linux-kernel-module-so-that-it-is-compatible-with-all-kernel-rele/45429681#45429681[the Linux kernel does not have a stable kernel module API].
* bugs can easily break you system. E.g.:
** segfaults can trivially lead to a kernel crash, and require a reboot
** your disk could get erased. Yes, this can also happen with `sudo` from userland. But you should not use `sudo` when developing newbie programs. And for the kernel you don't have the choice not to use `sudo`
** even more subtle system corruption such as https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/78858/cannot-remove-or-reinsert-kernel-module-after-error-while-inserting-it-without-r[not being able to rmmod]
* can't control which hardware is used, notably the CPU architecture
* can't step debug it with GDB easily

Still interested?

....
cd kernel_module
./make-host.sh
....

If the compilation of any of the C files fails because of kernel or toolchain differences that we don't control on the host, just rename it to remove the `.c` extension and try again:

....
mv broken.c broken.c~
./build_host
....

Once you manage to compile, and have come to terms with the fact that this may blow up your host, try it out with:

....
sudo insmod hello.ko

# Our module is there.
sudo lsmod | grep hello

# Last message should be: hello init
dmest -T

sudo rmmod hello

# Last message should be: hello exit
dmesg -T

# Not present anymore
sudo lsmod | grep hello
....

=== Hello host

Minimal host build system sanity check example.

....
cd hello_host
make
insmod hello.ko
dmesg
rmmod hello.ko
dmesg
....

== Buildroot

=== Change Buildroot options

We provide the following mechanisms:

* `./build -i br2_local`: append the file `br2_local` to a single build. Must be passed every time you run `./build`.
+
For convenience, we already gitignore `br2_local` for you.
+
....
cp br2_local.off br2_local
....
+
* `./build -c 'BR2_SOM_OPTION="myval"'`: append a single option to a single build.

=== ccache

We have link:https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#ccache[enabled ccached] builds by default.

`BR2_CCACHE_USE_BASEDIR=n` is used, which means that:

* absolute paths are used and GDB can find source files
* but builds are not reused across separated LKMC directories

ccache can considerably speed up builds when you:

* are switching between multiple configurations for a given package to bisect something out, as mentioned at: <<use-your-own-kernel-config>>
* clean the build because things stopped working. We store the cache outside of this repository, so you can nuke away without fear

The default ccache environment variables are honored if you have them set, which we recommend you do. E.g., in your `.bashrc`:

....
export CCACHE_DIR=~/.ccache
export CCACHE_MAXSIZE="20G"
....

The choice basically comes down to:

* should I store my cache on my HD or SSD?
* how big is my build, and how many build configurations do I need to keep around at a time?

If you don't set it, the default is to use `~/.buildroot-ccache` with `5G`, which is a bit small for us.

I find it very relaxing to watch ccache at work with:

....
watch -n1 'make -C buildroot/output.x86_64~/ ccache-stats'
....

or if you have it installed on host and the environment variables exported simply with:

....
watch -n1 'ccache -s'
....

while a build is going on in another terminal and my cooler is humming. Especially when the hit count goes up ;-) The joys of system programming.

== Conversation

=== kmod

Multi-call executable that implements: `lsmod`, `insmod`, `rmmod`, and other tools on desktop distros such as Ubuntu 16.04, where e.g.:

....
ls -l /bin/lsmod
....

gives:

....
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Jul 25 15:35 /bin/lsmod -> kmod
....

and:

....
dpkg -l | grep -Ei
....

contains:

....
ii  kmod                                        22-1ubuntu5                                         amd64        tools for managing Linux kernel modules
....

BusyBox also implements its own version of those executables. There are some differences.

Buildroot also has a kmod package, but we are not using it since BusyBox' version is good enough so far.

This page will only describe features that differ from kmod to the BusyBox implementation.

Source code: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/kernel/kmod/kmod.git

==== module-init-tools

Name of a predecessor set of tools.

==== modprobe

Load module under different name to avoid conflicts:

....
sudo modprobe vmhgfs -o vm_hgfs
....

=== Device tree

`platform_device.c` together with its kernel and QEMU forks contains a minimal runnable example.

Good format descriptions:

* https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md

Minimal example

....
/dts-v1/;

/ {
    a;
};
....

Check correctness with:

....
dtc a.dts
....

Separate nodes are simply merged by node path, e.g.:

....
/dts-v1/;

/ {
    a;
};

/ {
    b;
};
....

then `dtc a.dts` gives:

....
/dts-v1/;

/ {
        a;
        b;
};
....

==== How to update the Linux kernel?

....
# Last point before out patches.
last_mainline_revision=v4.14
next_mainline_revision=v4.15
cd linux

# Create a branch before the rebase.
git branch "lkmc-${last_mainline_revision}"
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:cirosantilli/linux.git
git push

git remote add up git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
git fetch up
git rebase --onto "$next_mainline_revision" "$last_mainline_revision"
./build -l
# Manually fix our kernel modules if necessary.

cd ..
git branch "buildroot-2017.08-linux-${last_mainline_revision}"
git add .
git commit -m "Linux ${next_mainline_revision}"
git push
....

and update the README!

During update all you kernel modules may break since the kernel API is not stable.

They are usually trivial breaks of things moving around headers or to sub-structs.

The userland, however, should simply not break, as Linus enforces strict backwards compatibility of userland interfaces.

This backwards compatibility is just awesome, it makes getting and running the latest master painless.

This also makes this repo the perfect setup to develop the Linux kernel.

==== How to downgrade the Linux kernel?

The kernel is not forward compatible, however, so downgrading the Linux kernel requires downgrading the userland too to the latest Buildroot branch that supports it.

The default Linux kernel version is bumped in Buildroot with commit messages of type:

....
linux: bump default to version 4.9.6
....

So you can try:

....
git log --grep 'linux: bump default to version'
....

Those commits change `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_LATEST_VERSION` in `/linux/Config.in`.

You should then look up if there is a branch that supports that kernel. Staying on branches is a good idea as they will get backports, in particular ones that fix the build as newer host versions come out.

==== How to add new Buildroot options?

....
cd buildroot/output.x86_64~
make menuconfig
....

Hit `/` and search for the settings.

Save and quit.

....
diff .config.olg .config
....

Copy and paste the diff additions to link:br2[].

==== Benchmarking this repo

In this section document how fast the build and clone are, and how to investigate them.

Send a pull request if you try it out on something significantly different.

===== What is making my build so slow?

....
cd buildroot/output.x86_64~
make graph-build
xdg-open graphs/build.pie-packages.pdf
....

Our philosophy is:

* if something adds little to the build time, build it in by default
* otherwise, make it optional

The biggest time hog is always GCC, can we use a precompiled one? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10833672/buildroot-environment-with-host-toolchain

===== Benchmark machines

The build times are calculated after doing link:https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#_offline_builds[`make source`], which downloads the sources, and basically benchmarks the Internet.

=== About

This project is for people who want to learn and modify low level system components:

* Linux kernel and Linux kernel modules
* full systems emulators like QEMU and gem5
* C standard libraries. This could also be put on a submodule if people show interest.
* Buildroot. We use and therefore document, a large part of its feature set.

Philosophy:

* automate as much as possible to make things more reproducible
* do everything from source to make things understandable and hackable

This project should be called "Linux kernel playground", like: https://github.com/Fuzion24/AndroidKernelExploitationPlayground maybe I'll rename it some day. Would semi conflict with: http://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/jwboyer/kernel-playground/ though.

==== Fairy tale

____
Once upon a time, there was a boy called Linus.

Linus made a super fun toy, and since he was not very humble, decided to call it Linux.

Linux was an awesome toy, but it had one big problem: it was very difficult to learn how to play with it!

As a result, only some weird kids who were very bored ended up playing with Linux, and everyone thought those kids were very cool, in their own weird way.

One day, a mysterious new kid called Ciro tried to play with Linux, and like many before him, got very frustrated, and gave up.

A few years later, Ciro had grown up a bit, and by chance came across a very cool toy made by the boy Petazzoni and his gang: it was called Buildroot.

Ciro noticed that if you used Buildroot together with Linux, Linux suddenly became very fun to play with!

So Ciro decided to explain to as many kids as possible how to use Buildroot to play with Linux.

And so everyone was happy. Except some of the old weird kernel hackers who wanted to keep their mystique, but so be it.

THE END
