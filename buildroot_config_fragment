# Provides setpci and a lspci more advanced than Busybox's
#
# setpci can read and write to PCI configuration registers.
#
# Read is possible from Linux with:
#
#     hexdump /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:05.0/config
#
# and /dev/mem can of course do both reads and writes,
# but setpci provies nice human readable register names, e.g.:
#
#     setpci --dumpregs
#
# then and then get the values with either bus or device id:
#
#     setpci -s 0000:00:05.0 BASE_ADDRESS_0
#     setpci -d 1234:11e9 BASE_ADDRESS_0
#
# Note however that BASE_ADDRESS_0 also appears when you do:
#
#     lspci -v
#
# Then you can try messing with that address with:
#
#     devmem2 0xfeb52000 w 0x12345678
#
# which for our pci_min device fires interrupts.
