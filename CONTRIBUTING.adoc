== Testing

Testing that should be done for every functional patch.

=== Guest testing

....
./build
./run -e '- lkmc_eval="/insrm.sh hello 5;wget -S google.com;poweroff;"' -n
....

Should:

* boot
* show `hello.ko` `init` and `exit` messages
* make a network request
* shutdown gracefully

TODO automate all of this with a `/test-all.sh` script in guest which outputs to stdout `LKMC_TEST_PASS` or `LKMC_TEST_FAIL` and grep that from host.

=== Host testing

* `./run -d` and on another shell `./rungdb start_kernel` should break GDB at `start_kernel`
