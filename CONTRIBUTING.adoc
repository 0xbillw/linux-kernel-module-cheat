= CONTRIBUTING

Testing that should be done for every functional patch:

* `./build && ./run` boots
* `/insrm.sh hello 5`. If a new module was added, use this for that module. Helps catch simple insert remove problems.
* `wget -O- google.com` for Internet
* `./run -d` and on another shell `./rungdb start_kernel` should break GDB at `start_kernel`
