# Bibliography

Runnable stuff:

- <https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/> the best book, but outdated. Updated source: <https://github.com/martinezjavier/ldd3> But examples non-minimal and take too much brain power to understand.
- <https://github.com/satoru-takeuchi/elkdat> manual build process without Buildroot, very few and simple kernel modules
- <https://github.com/tinyclub/linux-lab> Buildroot based, no kernel modules?
- <https://github.com/agelastic/eudyptula>

Theory:

- <https://lwn.net>
- <http://www.makelinux.net>
- <http://nairobi-embedded.org/> you will fall here a lot when the hard Google queries start popping
