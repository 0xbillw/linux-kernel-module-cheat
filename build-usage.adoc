== build configuration options

[options="header"]

|Name |Argument name        |Description
|`-a` |`ARCH`               |Build for architecture `ARCH`.
|`-b` |`BR2_FILE`           |Also use the given Buildroot configuration fragment file.
                             Pass multiple times to use multiple fragment files.
|`-B` |`BR2_CONFIG`         |Add a single Buildroot option to the current build.
                             Example: `-B 'BR2_TARGET_ROOTFS_EXT2_SIZE="512M"'`
|`-c` |`BR2_FILE`           |Also use the given Buildroot configuration fragment file.
                             Pass multiple times to use multiple fragment files.
|`-C` |                     |Skip the Buildroot configuration. Saves a few seconds,
                             but requires you to know what you are doing :-)
|`-g` |                     |Enable gem5 build and disable QEMU build. You also need
                             to use `-G` or `-- gem5-reconfigure` to rebuild gem5
                             after the initial build.
|`-h` |                     |Show this help message.
|`-I` |                     |Enable initramfs for the current build.
|`-i` |                     |Enable initrd for the current build.
|`-K` |`KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE` |Use `KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE` as the exact Linux kernel
                             configuration. Ignore the default `kernel_config_fragment`.
|`-p` |                     |Pass extra arguments to the `rootfs_post_build_script`.
|`-S` |                     |Don't build QEMU with SDL support.
                             Graphics such as X11 won't work, only the terminal.
|`-v` |                     |Do a verbose build.
