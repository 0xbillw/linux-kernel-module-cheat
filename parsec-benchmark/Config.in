# Needed if you want to run the full parsec benchmark inside the guest.
#
# Parsec shell scripts use a hardcoded /bin/bash
#
# One option would be to try and use /bin/sh.
# But symlinking fails because of BusyBox' symlink mechanism.
# The other option would be to patch Parsec to use /bin/sh and be POSIX compliant.
# But let's take the path of smallest resistance for now.
#
# This is a bit coarse and makes the image larger with useless source code.
#
# But according to du, the source accounts for only 1/5 of the total size,
# so benchmarks dominate, and it doesn't matter much.
#
# Also it is not so critical for simulators anyways unlike real embedded systems.
#
# One possibility to make this better may be to install only the 'inst/' and 'input/'
# folders for each package + toplevel '/bin/' and '/config/', but of course we won't
# know if this works until time consuming testing is done :-)
